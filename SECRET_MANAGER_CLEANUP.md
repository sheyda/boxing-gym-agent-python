# 🧹 Secret Manager Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup of Google Cloud Secret Manager to remove unnecessary configuration secrets and keep only truly sensitive data.

## 📊 Cleanup Results

### 🗑️ **Deleted Secrets (15 total)**
The following configuration secrets were removed as they contained non-sensitive values:

| Secret Name | Previous Value | Reason for Removal |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `boxing-gym-email` | `boxing_gym@gmail.com` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `boxing-gym-name` | `Boxing Gym` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `calendar-id` | `primary` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `check-interval-minutes` | `5` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `confidence-threshold` | `0.7` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `enable-auto-registration` | `false` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `enable-calendar-creation` | `true` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `event-duration-minutes` | `60` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `gmail-query` | `from:boxing_gym@gmail.com subject:class registration` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `google-redirect-uri` | `http://localhost:8080/oauth2callback` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `llm-model` | `gpt-4-turbo-preview` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `llm-provider` | `openai` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `log-level` | `INFO` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `max-emails-per-check` | `10` | Non-sensitive configuration |
| `timezone` | `America/New_York` | Non-sensitive configuration |

### ✅ **Kept Secrets (5 total)**
The following secrets were retained as they contain truly sensitive data:

| Secret Name | Contains | Security Level |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| `google-client-id` | OAuth2 client ID | Sensitive |
| `google-client-secret` | OAuth2 client secret | Highly Sensitive |
| `openai-api-key` | OpenAI API key | Highly Sensitive |
| `gmail-tokens` | Gmail OAuth2 tokens | Highly Sensitive |
| `gmail-user-email` | Personal email address | Privacy Sensitive |

## 💰 **Benefits of Cleanup**

### Cost Reduction
- **75% fewer secrets** (20 → 5)
- Reduced Secret Manager costs
- Lower operational overhead

### Complexity Reduction
- **Simpler management** - Only 5 secrets to maintain
- **Clearer separation** - Secrets vs. configuration are distinct
- **Easier deployment** - Fewer secrets to configure

### Security Improvement
- **Focused protection** - Only truly sensitive data is protected
- **Reduced attack surface** - Fewer secrets to potentially compromise
- **Better practices** - Follows principle of least privilege

## 🚀 **Updated Deployment Approach**

### Hybrid Deployment (Recommended)
Use the new `deploy-hybrid.sh.example` script which:
- **Stores sensitive data** in Secret Manager (5 secrets)
- **Uses environment variables** for configuration values
- **Reduces complexity** while maintaining security

### Configuration Values (Now in Environment Variables)
These values are now passed as environment variables during deployment:
- `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5`
- `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`
- `TIMEZONE=America/New_York`
- `CALENDAR_ID=primary`
- `LLM_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview`
- And 10+ other configuration values

## 📋 **Migration Guide**

If you were using the old full-secrets approach:

1. **Update your deployment script** to use `deploy-hybrid.sh.example`
2. **Remove references** to deleted secrets in your code
3. **Use environment variables** for configuration values
4. **Keep using Secret Manager** for the 5 remaining sensitive secrets

## 🎯 **Best Practices Going Forward**

### ✅ **Store in Secret Manager:**
- API keys and tokens
- OAuth2 client credentials
- Personal/private information
- Database passwords
- Encryption keys

### ❌ **Don't Store in Secret Manager:**
- Configuration values (timeouts, intervals)
- Default settings (log levels, feature flags)
- Non-sensitive identifiers (calendar IDs, model names)
- Public configuration (timezones, URLs)

## 📅 **Cleanup Date**
**October 6, 2025** - Secret Manager cleanup completed successfully.

---

**Result**: Secret Manager is now properly configured with only truly sensitive data, reducing complexity and cost while maintaining security. 🎉
